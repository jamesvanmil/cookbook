# Macaroni and Cheese

## Ingredients

  * 2 cups milk (whole preferred)
  * 1 lb cheese, grated (white cheddar preferred)
  * 2 tablespoons butter
  * 3 tablespoons flour
  * 12 oz dry pasta, cooked and drained
  * spices as desired (I like nutmeg with black pepper or chipotle with black pepper)
  * No salt! (The cheese has more then enough, really)

## Instructions

### Roux > Bechamel > Mornay

  1. Warm the milk on the stove-top or in the microwave (warm milk helps the sauce to come together).
  1. Melt the butter over low heat. After the butter melts, allow it to simmer until most of the bubbles are gone; a deep golden hue is okay, but do not allow the butter to brown (cooking the water out of the butter helps the sauce to come together without lumps).
  1. Add the flour to the butter and whisk until combined. Continue to cook, whisking occasionally, until the color deepens slightly. 
  1. Yay! You've made roux!
  1. Slowly add the warm/hot milk, whisking to combine. At first you'll want to add it *very* gradually, to avoid forming lumps, but as the sauce comes together you can add it more quickly.
  1. Yay! You've made Bechamel! This is a good time to add spices. It's hard to overdo it with the black pepper, but be more conservative with the nutmeg, if you're using that.
  1. Add your cheese, a handful at a time, until it all melts. Whisk occasionally as you add.
  1. Yay! You've made sauce Mornay. The sauce will be a bit thin; allow it to cook on low heat for 10-15 minutes, and it'll get to a good consistency. Also add more spices if you like.

### Baking

  1. Add enough sauce to generously lather the pasta.
  1. Put it in a pan.
  1. Add some shit to it (or don't). Ham is pretty good in the nutmeg/pepper version. You could add vegetables to it if you're an asshole (I'd parboil them).
  1. Put some shit on top of it. Some folks like breadcrumbs. I like more cheese.
  1. Bake for 30-40 minutes at 375 degrees, or until the edges and tops have nice color.

P.S. - for more thorough guidance on the sauce, consult the relevant chapter in *Mastering the Art of French Cooking / Julia Child*.
