# Spaetzle

## Ingredients

   * 1 cup all-purpose flour
   * 1 teaspoon salt
   * 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
   * 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
   * 2 large eggs
   * 1/4 cup milk
   * 3 tablespoons unsalted butter (optional)
   * 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives (optional)

## Directions

   1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
   2. In another mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the egg-milk mixture.
   3. Gradually draw in the flour from the sides and combine well; the dough should be smooth and thick. Let the dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
   4. Bring 3 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot, then reduce to a simmer.
   5. To form the spaetzle, hold a large holed colander or slotted spoon over the simmering water and push the dough through the holes with a spatula or spoon. (or use a cookie gun!) Do this in batches so you don't overcrowd the pot.
   6. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until the spaetzle floats to the surface, stirring gently to prevent sticking. Dump the spaetzle into a colander and give it a quick rinse with cool water.
   7. (Optional) Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and add the spaetzle; tossing to coat. Cook the spaetzle for 1 to 2 minutes to give the noodles some color, and then sprinkle with the chopped chives and season with salt and pepper before serving.
