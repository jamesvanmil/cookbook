# Sweet Potato Gratin

## Ingredients:

   * Carmelized onions (it's hard to have too many of these for this recipe)
   * 8 medium sweet potatoes, about 4 pounds, peeled
   * 2 cups heavy cream
   * 1 cup maple syrup
   * Salt    

## Instructions:

   1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
   2. Slice the potatoes very thin on a mandolin, and layer into a baking dish, adding salt every few layers
   3. Combine the cream and maple syrup in a small saucepan, and scald over high heat; pour the mixture while still hot over the potatoes, until it comes about 3/4 of the way up the potatoes.
   4. Finish with a layer of caramelized onions, cover dish with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes until the sweet potatoes are soft when tested with a knife. Remove from the oven, and allow to rest for about 30 minutes.
