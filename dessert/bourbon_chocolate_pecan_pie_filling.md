# Bourban Chocolate Pecan Pie Filling

## Ingredients:

  * 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
  * 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate
  * 3 large eggs
  * 1 cup sugar
  * 3/4 cup dark corn syrup or sugar cane syrup (such as Steen's)
  * 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
  * 3 tablespoons bourbon
  * 1/4 teaspoon salt
  * 1 1/2 cups pecan halves (or more)

## Instructions:

   * Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
   * To make the filling: melt the butter and chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, remove from heat and let cool.
   * Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl until frothy and then blend in the sugar. Stir in the syrup, vanilla, bourbon, salt, and the melted butter mixture until well blended.
   * Arrange the pecans on the bottom of the pie crust and carefully pour the egg mixture over them. 
   * Bake until the filling is set and slightly puffed, about 45 minutes. Test for doneness by sticking a thin knife in the center of the pie, if it comes out pretty clean, you're good to go.
   * Transfer the pie to rack and cool completely before cutting.
