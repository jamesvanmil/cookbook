# Chili con Carne

Note: this isn't really a recipe, more of a method

## Sauce

The sauce for this recipe is build on top of dried chile peppers. I like to use a mix of three chiles:

* Pasilla
* Ancho
* Guajillo

### Directions

1. Start by briefly washing the chiles, then cut off the stems and butterfly open the chile pods. Remove as many seed as you can and discard them (this can be done with the help of some running water).
1. If wet, pat the chiles dry with paper towels and arrange on a baking sheet.
1. Roast the chiles in the oven at 350, until they just start to blacken.
1. Submerge the roasted chiles with hot water off of the boil, and allow to soak for 30 minutes. The water should just cover the chiles, and you may want to weight them to help keep them submerged.
1. After the 30 minutes, blend the water/chile mixture (with an immersion blender if you have one) until throughly processed.
1. With a spatula or wooden spoon, press the mixture through a sieve or chinois, in batches, discarding the pepper skins that remain in the sieve.
1. You have a sauce!

## Stew it

1. What kind of protein do you want to use?
    * Chunks of tough, fatty beef are great - like beef chuck. If you're using that, trim to 1" pieces and brow in some oil.
    * Beans are also great - soak them if you can, using about 1 tablespoon of salt for every quart of soaking water
    * No one is stopping you from using ground beef/turkey/sausage, if you want - I guess you should probably brown it? (for the love of god please keep the fat).
1. Sweat your aromatics. If you browned meat, then remove sweat the veggies in that same pot - this is a good chance to get some of the fond off of the bottom of that pot.
    * Good aromatics include:
        * onions
        * fresh peppers
        * celery
1. Add stuff:
    * Add your veggies and proteins back to the cooking pot.
    * Add some tasty liquid - a reasonable malty beer, like a Vienna lager, is a good choice.
    * Add the chile sauce.
1. Cook until done.
1. If you're making a vegetarian/vegan chili, I recommend adding wheat bulgur for the last 15 minutes.
